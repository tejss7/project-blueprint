              <h2 className="text-2xl font-light text-neon-aqua mb-6 tracking-wide">The Problem with Traditional Branding</h2>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                For decades, brands have followed a predictable formula: identify your target demographic, create a visual identity, push out messaging, and hope for recognition. This approach worked in a world with limited channels and captive audiences.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed">
                But today's landscape is fundamentally different. Consumers don't just buy products—they join movements. They don't just choose brands—they align with values. The old playbook isn't just outdated; it's actively counterproductive.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-light text-neon-aqua mb-6 tracking-wide">The Culture-First Imperative</h2>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Modern brands must start with culture. Not company culture, but the broader cultural context in which they exist. What conversations are happening? What movements are emerging? What values are shifting?
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed">
                Culture-first branding means understanding these dynamics before crafting your position. It means listening before speaking, observing before creating, and participating before promoting.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className="cinematic-card p-10 rounded-sm">
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-light text-neon-aqua mb-6 tracking-wide">What Comes Next</h2>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The future belongs to brands that can decode culture, identify emerging patterns, and position themselves as authentic participants rather than opportunistic observers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This requires new tools, new thinking, and new courage. It means embracing ambiguity, moving faster, and being willing to take creative risks that conventional brand strategies would never approve.
              </p>
              <p className="text-foreground/70 font-light leading-relaxed">
                The end of ordinary branding isn't a loss—it's an opportunity. For those brave enough to reimagine what branding can be.
